# Chat_Assistant
This project is a Python-based chat assistant that interacts with an SQLite database to answer user queries. The assistant processes natural language queries, converts them into SQL, fetches relevant data, and provides a formatted response. The system is built using Flask for handling HTTP requests and SQLite3 as the database engine.
